## Hi everyone ðŸ‘‹

#### I love creating games :video_game: 
#### I tried to create them on Godot, Unity, and Unreal Engine. Unreal is my favorite :rocket: Welcome to my code life

##### Let's get acquainted with my works :arrow_down:

<h2 align="center"><a href="https://github.com/marchakboh/JAMProject">2023 GAME JAM</a></h2>
<p></p>

#### This Game Jam has already been held on a larger scale, and on a different game engine - Unity. This time, everything was in 3D. New challenges and experiences, and most importantly - a fun game :)

<h2 align="center"><a href="https://github.com/kuchermv/GLJam22">2022 GAME JAM</a></h2>
<p></p>

#### It was my first Game Jam. And it was really cool. A 2D game with the main idea of "It's not supposed to do that". It was fun :)

#### There was a time when I was writing a bachelor's project. I decided to make my own CI/CD manager that could graphically make startup scripts. I liked Qt development.

<h2 align="center"><a href="https://github.com/marchakboh/ArcPlanets">ArcPlanets</a></h2>
<p></p>

#### Once I tried to figure out an engine I didn't know. And that's how this game was born :) It's not very interesting, and it's buggy, but this "trial by fire" helped me a lot.

#### This is a _client-server_ application of an online car seat shop. The development of this application was accompanied by the fact that I studied the **_Qt framework_** and data transfer via _TCP IP protocol_.

<p align="center">

</p>

#### This is a _console game_ of the _arcade_ genre :gun:, which is written entirely by _the paradigm of procedural programming_ using C++.

<h2 align="center">Additionally</h2>

### I also have a few more versions of the game I once wrote on Java:

* [Bubble world 1.0](https://github.com/RiyanBliTe/Bubble_world_1)
* [Bubble world 1.2](https://github.com/RiyanBliTe/Bubble_world_1.2)

##### But once I stopped encouraging their development, so it's a _dead project_.
